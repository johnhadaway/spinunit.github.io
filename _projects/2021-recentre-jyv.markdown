Ensuring a city’s success and innovations based on urban assets requires connections and proximities, urban density and diversity of activities. A city can grow economically and socially without expanding if it is capable of more densely concentrating capital, jobs and social interactions. From this perspective, the efficient organisation of car-parking, evading a substantial increase of required parking spaces, has wide consequences for Tallinn’s economic growth, social cohesion and quality of life.
