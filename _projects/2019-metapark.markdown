description: A performance-based parking policy for the city Tallinn.
question: How to design a performance-based parking policy?
---

Ensuring a city’s success based on urban assets requires physical connections, proximities, urban density and a high diversity of activities. This usually comes with a heavy dose of space dedicated to parking vehicles, which, inversely to what is generally thought, can hinder local economic growth, social cohesion and the overall quality of life.

> metaPark aimed to draft a parking policy reform in Tallinn, harnessing the real economic value of parking space and returning it to the city.

*Extract from the digital parking map of Tallinn.*

We first embarked on the challenge to map each single parking space in the city, formal or not, by combining real-time parking data with satellite imagery and on-site surveys. This allowed measuring the actual occupancy rates of all paid-parking spots using mobile payment data to draft a data-informed policy reform. This data was made useful by turning it into an interactive tool for policy-makers to see the occupancy rate and pricing of each single parking place in the municipality. Such a map previously did not exist, as there was no coordination and data aggregation between private and public parking service providers.

Our policy proposal was the establishment of the Active Transit Area (ATA), defined as the area where public transport is the most accessible and efficient.

> The logic is rather simple: if public transit and fast and conveniente, you pay for parking.

*The Active Transit Area in Tallinn to define the pay-parking zone.*

The more the public transport will be accessible and efficient, the larger the Active Transit Area will be. The ATA is also used in planning law to set parking caps. The parking requirements for new projects within the ATA will be capped. For developments prjects outside the ATA the minimum parking requirements are lifted to use market dynamics determine their number and price.**This generates a self-reinforcing loop: the more the city invests on public transport – the more efficient it is.**
