Ensuring a city’s success and innovations based on urban assets requires connections and proximities, urban density and diversity of activities. A city can grow economically and socially without expanding if it is capable of more densely concentrating capital, jobs and social interactions. From this perspective, the efficient organisation of car-parking, evading a substantial increase of required parking spaces, has wide consequences for Tallinn’s economic growth, social cohesion and quality of life.

Searching for added value, metaPARK project views parking policy as an issue of urbanisation, quality-of-life and business, as a driver for better, more competitive and more pleasant Tallinn.

Currently, the dominant man-made land use in Tallinn is dedicated to cars. The space for pedestrians seems substantial but the bare measurement of brutto area of uses does not speak for their qualities and performances. Yet, this data can be used to trigger positive change in the next policies and try to reduce the ratio of parking and street surfaces in favour of other sustainable uses.
