question: How to design a performance-based parking policy?
---



Ensuring a cityâ€™s success based on urban assets requires physical connections, proximities, urban density and a high diversity of activities. This usually comes with a heavy dose of space dedicated to parking vehicles, which, inversely to what is generally thought, can hinder local economic growth, social cohesion and the overall quality of life.
metaPark aimed to draft a parking policy reform in Tallinn, harnessing the real economic value of parking space and returning it to the city.

We first embarked on the challenge to map each single parking space in the city, formal or not, by combining real-time parking data with satellite imagery and on-site surveys. This allowed measuring the actual occupancy rates of all paid-parking spots collected in real-time and proposing a data-informed policy reform. This data was made useful by turning it into an interactive tool for policy-makers to see the occupancy rate and pricing of each single parking place in the municipality. Such a map previously did not exist, as there was no coordination and data aggregation between private and public parking service providers.
