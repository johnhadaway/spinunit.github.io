description: A resaerch pilot to explore new data sources to map building vacancies.
question: What are the reliable data sources to map shrinkage?
---

In 2018 the Ministry of Finance started to received dozens unwanted apartments of apartments from people in East Estonia. The debate on shrinking cities was already open, but this became a turning point and a surprise, particularly given that at the time, interest rates were low, and housing prices were on a steady rise - 5,7% year-on-year. This phenomenon spun a new investigation branch in Estonia, focusing on the relationships between demographic change and the built environment. 

A year later, we initiated a research pilot for the Estonian Ministry of Finance in East Estonia (Ida Viru region) to design a methodology to map shrinkage and evaluate its risks to socio-economic development. Our core objective was to find a reliable data source to understand vacancies at the building level.

Our team dived into all available data sources and eventually **produced a methodology for making electricity consumption data meaningful to mapping vacancy rates.**

This pilot revealed that building vacancy reached an alarming rate of 25%, and highly vacant buildings tended to cluster. Moreover, areas with increasingly empty buildings were characterised by historic houses with cultural, architectural and natural significance.
